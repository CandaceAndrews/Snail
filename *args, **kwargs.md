### *args and **kwargs Notes

*args and **kwargs are used to handle variable length arguments in Python. *args is used to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function, while **kwargs is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments.

In the context of Django views, *args and **kwargs are used to pass additional arguments to a view function that are not part of the URL route. For example, if you have a URL route like /users/<int:pk>/ and you want to pass additional arguments to the view function, you can use *args and **kwargs to handle them.

In the case of the delete and put methods in the UserCardsCreated view, request is the first argument, *args is used to handle any additional positional arguments (which in this case, there are none), and **kwargs is used to handle any additional keyword arguments, such as the pk parameter in the URL route. By using *args and **kwargs, we can handle any additional arguments that are not part of the URL route in a flexible way.

Suppose you have a function that calculates the sum of an arbitrary number of integers. One way to write this function would be to accept the integers as arguments to the function, like so:

```
def sum_integers(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c
```

However, if you don't know how many integers you will be summing ahead of time, this approach won't work. Instead, you can use *args to pass a variable number of arguments to the function. Here's an updated version of the sum_integers function that uses *args:

```
def sum_integers(*args):
    return sum(args)

```

Now, you can call the sum_integers function with any number of integers, like so:
```
>>> sum_integers(1, 2, 3)
6
>>> sum_integers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
15
>>> sum_integers(1, 2)
3

```

As you can see, *args allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function, which can be useful in many different contexts.
