# ORM

In Python, ORM stands for `Object-Relational Mapping`. It is a technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using object-oriented programming concepts. ORM libraries provide a way to map the data stored in database tables to Python objects, making it easier to perform database operations without writing raw SQL queries.

ORM libraries in Python provide a layer of abstraction that simplifies the interaction with databases. Instead of manually writing SQL statements to create tables, insert data, and perform queries, developers can define Python classes that represent database tables. These classes are typically referred to as "models" and are used to define the structure of the data and the relationships between different tables.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how ORM works in Python:

- `Define a Model:` Start by defining a Python class that represents a table in the database. Each attribute of the class corresponds to a column in the table, and the class itself represents a row or record. The ORM library provides decorators or methods to define these mappings.

- `Map Relationships:` If there are relationships between tables, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships, you can define them using ORM techniques. This helps in retrieving related data easily.

- `Perform CRUD Operations:` Once the models are defined, you can use ORM methods or APIs provided by the library to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on the database. These methods abstract the underlying SQL queries required to interact with the database.

- `Automatic Query Generation:` ORM libraries generate the necessary SQL queries based on the methods or APIs called on the models. This eliminates the need to write raw SQL statements manually, making the code more readable and maintainable.

- `Data Retrieval: `To retrieve data from the database, you can use ORM methods like filtering, ordering, or aggregating to specify the conditions and criteria. The ORM library will translate these operations into SQL queries and return the result as Python objects.

- `Data Modification:` Similarly, you can modify the data by updating or deleting objects directly using ORM methods or APIs. The library will handle the necessary SQL operations to reflect these changes in the database.

Some popular ORM libraries in Python include SQLAlchemy, Django ORM (part of the Django web framework), and Peewee. These libraries offer different features, levels of complexity, and support for various database systems, allowing developers to choose the one that best fits their requirements.

Overall, ORM in Python simplifies database interactions by providing an abstraction layer, allowing developers to work with databases using object-oriented programming paradigms instead of dealing with low-level SQL queries directly.
