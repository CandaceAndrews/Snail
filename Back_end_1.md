Back-end day #1:

* git reset â€”hard origin/main
	(Make changes go away and make yours look like git hub)

* git clean -xdf
	(Delete files in directory)

* pipenv install
	(To have same dependencies that the original branch has that you pulled)



DO EACH TIME WHEN YOU PULL GITHUB MAIN:
* Pipenv install
* Python manage.py migrate
