### Terms

1. **API**: Application Programming Interface. It defines how different software components should interact with each other.

2. **REST**: Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications using HTTP protocols. Understanding RESTful principles is crucial for designing scalable and maintainable APIs.

3. **Database**: A structured collection of data that is organized and accessible in various ways. Familiarize yourself with relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) and their differences.

4. **SQL**: Structured Query Language. It is a standard language for managing and querying relational databases. Knowledge of SQL is essential for working with databases effectively.

5. **ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping. It is a technique used to map data between an object-oriented programming language and a relational database. Familiarize yourself with popular ORMs like Hibernate (Java), Entity Framework (C#), or SQLAlchemy (Python).

6. **Caching**: The process of storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage system to improve performance. Learn about caching techniques and tools such as Memcached or Redis.

7. **Message Queue**: A communication mechanism that allows different components of a system to communicate asynchronously by sending and receiving messages. Familiarize yourself with popular message queue systems like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or ActiveMQ.

8. **Microservices**: An architectural pattern where an application is divided into loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Understand the principles behind microservices and how to design and manage them effectively.

9. **Containerization**: Packaging software applications and their dependencies into containers to ensure consistency across different environments. Learn about Docker and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

10. **Authentication and Authorization**: The processes of verifying the identity of users and determining their access rights. Familiarize yourself with common authentication mechanisms like OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and session-based authentication.

11. **Security**: Understand common security vulnerabilities and best practices for securing web applications, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), SQL injection, etc.

12. **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased workload or user demand. Be aware of scalability concepts like horizontal scaling, vertical scaling, load balancing, and distributed systems.

13. **Version Control**: Understanding version control systems like Git and their key concepts, such as branching, merging, and resolving conflicts, is crucial for collaborating on codebases effectively.

14. **Testing**: Familiarize yourself with different testing methodologies (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing) and tools/frameworks like JUnit, PyTest, and Selenium.

15. **Performance Optimization**: Techniques for improving the speed and efficiency of software applications. Learn about profiling, caching, query optimization, and other performance optimization strategies.
